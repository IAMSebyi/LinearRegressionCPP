# Linear Regression Model in C++

This project implements a linear regression model with multiple input features in C++ for educational purposes. It includes methods to train the model using gradient descent, predict outputs for given inputs, and calculate the model parameters.

## Features

- Train a linear regression model using gradient descent.
- Predict target values for new input data.
- Calculate and output model parameters (coefficients and intercept).
- Handle multiple input features and data points.
